Description: RPC protocol compiler and definitions
 rpcgen is a tool that generates C code to implement an RPC protocol. The input
 to rpcgen is a language similar to C known as RPC Language (Remote Procedure
 Call Language).
 .
 This package also includes several rpcsvc header files and RPC protocol
 definitions from SunRPC sources that were previously shipped by glibc.
